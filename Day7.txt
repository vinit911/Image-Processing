Day 7

Problem Statement:

"Perform Fillbucket operation like in MS-Paint"
"Counting the number of goals in Robosoccer"


Fillbucket:

First used a mouse-click function to get the coordinates of the points at which the mouse is clicked.
Then start a DFS until all the white pixel inside the borders are coloured.
I used a condition that if mouse is clicked on the borders than it will perform no task.

Robosoccer:
First I made a program to find the coordinates of the goal post
Then I extracted the orange colour of the ball
Using the colour of the ball I kept track of its movement
I declared an array(for each team) which stores a value each frame. It stores 1 if ball inside the goal post and else 0
The point at which the array has a change in value from 1 to 0 is declared as a goal
